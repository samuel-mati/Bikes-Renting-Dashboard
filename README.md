# Bikes-Renting-Dashboard

I take pride in this simple yet insightful dashboard since it clearly depicts different angles for viewing the renting of bikes in New york City.

It shows different bike rentals across different situations including, temperatures,  day, pick up stations, Age of the person renting, user type, season etc.

I believe the insights presented by this dashboard are very critical to help the management in making sound decisions.
For example the distribution across different pick up stations and seasons can help them make decisions on which is the better station and season to push more resources respectively
